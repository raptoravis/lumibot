Interactive Brokers (REST) Backtesting
======================================

LumiBot supports backtesting with **Interactive Brokers Client Portal (REST)**.

The primary data path uses Client Portal (REST) via the LumiBot Data Downloader (it does **not** require the legacy TWS API for bar history).

For **expired futures** contract discovery (conids), IBKR Client Portal cannot reliably discover old contracts. In that
case, LumiBot relies on an **offline conid registry** (populated via a one-time TWS backfill in internal deployments).

Status
------

IBKR REST backtesting is under active development and is not yet a fully-supported public workflow in the open-source
distribution.

If you want early access or have a specific use case, please open an issue (or contact the maintainers) so we can
prioritize it.

Quick Start
-----------

Select IBKR as the backtesting data source:

.. code-block:: bash

   export BACKTESTING_DATA_SOURCE="ibkr"

Supported Data
--------------

- **Futures**: contract bars via IBKR historical endpoints (1-minute+ bars).
- **Spot crypto**: IBKR crypto bars (availability depends on region and IBKR product support).

Expired Futures Contracts (conids)
----------------------------------

IBKR futures history requires a contract identifier (``conid``). IBKR Client Portal cannot reliably discover ``conid``
values for **expired** futures contracts, which makes explicit-contract backtests fail unless the mapping is already
known.

LumiBot supports an offline conid registry (cache-backed, optionally S3-mirrored):

- ``LUMIBOT_CACHE_FOLDER/ibkr/conids.json``

Internal runbook (engineering): ``docs/investigations/2026-01-18_IBKR_EXPIRED_FUTURES_CONID_BACKFILL.md``.

Caching
-------

IBKR backtests cache historical bars as Parquet:

- Local: ``LUMIBOT_CACHE_FOLDER/ibkr/...``
- Optional S3 mirroring: configured via the standard ``LUMIBOT_CACHE_*`` variables (see :ref:`environment_variables`).

Multi-provider routing (Theta + IBKR)
-------------------------------------

To use multiple providers in a single backtest (example: ThetaData for options/stocks/indexes and IBKR for futures/crypto), set a JSON mapping in ``BACKTESTING_DATA_SOURCE``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export BACKTESTING_DATA_SOURCE='{"default":"thetadata","stock":"thetadata","option":"thetadata","index":"thetadata","future":"ibkr","crypto":"ibkr"}'

Routing values are case/whitespace/_/- insensitive. For crypto, you may also route to CCXT by using either ``"ccxt"`` (auto-select exchange) or a CCXT exchange id directly (for example: ``"coinbase"`` or ``"kraken"``).

Market Data Subscriptions (IBKR)
--------------------------------

IBKR requires appropriate **market data entitlements** to access market data via the API. IBKR notes that historical bars are part of Level 1 entitlements and that **crypto does not require additional market data subscriptions**:

For **CME futures** (ES/MES/NQ/MNQ), note that the cheap **CME S&P Indices** subscription is for index data, not futures contracts. Professional subscriber pricing and package availability can differ, so confirm your exact costs in the IBKR Market Data Subscriptions page and pricing table:

Authentication / Session Behavior
---------------------------------

The Client Portal Gateway is session-based; if the session becomes unauthenticated, the gateway must be re-authenticated. IBKR documents the expected authentication lifecycle and recommends using ``/iserver/auth/ssodh/init`` to re-authenticate in most scenarios:

Configuration Notes
-------------------

Common environment variables for IBKR REST backtesting:

- ``IBKR_HISTORY_SOURCE`` (default: ``Trades``)
- ``IBKR_FUTURES_EXCHANGE`` (default: ``CME``)
- ``IBKR_CRYPTO_VENUE`` (default: ``ZEROHASH``)
- ``LUMIBOT_IBKR_ENABLE_FUTURES_BID_ASK`` (default: disabled; opt-in quote derivation for futures)

See :ref:`environment_variables` for details.
